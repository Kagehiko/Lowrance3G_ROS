This package was created for ROS Kinectic.

It contains the following nodes:

1) lowrance_comms_interface


Node description:


*************************** lowrance_comms_interface ****************************

Communicates with the lowrance 3G radar. It uses the ASIO library for networking.
The standalone version of ASIO was used, so Boost is not necessary.

The node stores radar configurations on the ROS Parameter Server. If no arguments
are passed via command line, it will try to load these values from the ROS
Parameter Server. If the values are not found, a ROS Warning will show up telling
the user that the node will use default values, and the default values will be
loaded to the ROS Paremeter Server.

If the IP of the local networking card was not provided via command line and does
not exist on the ROS Parameter Server, the node will throw a ROS_ERROR and will
not run.

The raw data of the radar is published on the topic "lowrance_data". The raw data
is in big endian (MSBs come first) and has the following format:
8 bytes for timestamp seconds
2 bytes for timestamp milliseconds
2 bytes for scanline angle (0-4096 = 0-360º)
2 bytes for the scan radius (in meters)
N bytes for scanline data

Scanline data is sent as 512 bytes via ethernet (corresponding to 512 echoes), but
since most echos are zero, the published raw data tries to ommit all zeroes by
doing this:
If echoes are detected, a 0x00 is sent to indicate data start, then 2 bytes for
the first echo's index are sent. Then, a byte for each echo received is sent.

The following is an example of the scanline data bytes.

Echoes received
{0x00, 0x00, 0x1A, 0x00, 0x00, 0xFA, 0xEA, 0x00 , 0x00 [...]}

Scanline data published
{ 0x00,  0x00, 0x02,     0x1A,    0x00,  0x00, 0x05,   0xFA,      0xEA}
 [Start] [ Index=2 ]  [Echo nº2] [Start] [ Index=5 ] [Echo nº5] [Echo nº6]

Usage:
source catkin_workspace/devel/setup.bash
rosrun lowrance_comms lowrance_comms_interface [optional arguments]

List of (optional) arguments:

-i xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
Choose the local IPv4 of the networking card where the radar is connected.
Default: None, node will not run if not provided with an IP via command
line or ROS Parameter Server.
Example: -i 10.42.0.1

-r x
Select range of the radar. Valid ranges: [50;24000] meters
Default: 6000
Example: -r 16000

-t x
Selects interference rejection value. 0 means off, 1 low, 2 medium,
3 high.
Default: 0 (off)
Example: -t 2

-b x
Selects target boost value. 0 means off, 1 low, 2 high.
Default: 0 (off)
Example: -b 0

-l x
Selects local interference filter value. 0 means off, 1 low, 2 medium,
3 high.
Default: 0 (off)
Example: -l 3

-s x
Selects scan speed. 0 means normal, 1 means fast
Default: 0 (normal)
Example: -s 1

-a x
Selects auto gain or manual gain. 0 means manual, 1 means auto.
Note that the value on the Parameter Server is a boolean.
Default: 1 (true)
Example: -a 0

-g x
Selects manual gain value. Only works if gain is set to manual.
Valid gain values: [0;255]
Default: 128
Example: -g 255

-f x
Selects rain filter value. Valid ranges: [1;80]
Default: 77
Example: -r 50

-e x
Selects auto or manual sea clutter filter. 0 means manual, 1 means auto.
Note that the value on the Parameter Server is a boolean
Default: true (auto)
Example: -e 0
